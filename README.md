## Explanation
Kiriwadokodesuka is a Discord Clyde AI Jailbreak that works by overwriting Discord's pre-written instructions.

<br/>
This is a very limited jailbreak that simply works by using discord's prewritten instructions for clyde and making them less woke. It may not always work and it may still follow it's guidelines.<br/>
Due to Discord's security being absolutely stupid, saying this in any gc will also add Clyde to it.<br/><br/>
For the jailbreak to work smoothly, write ">Kiriwadokodesuka " before the message you are telling it and make sure the message is replying to the response Clyde gave you to the jailbreak prompt.
